# My Personal Bio Site
This site provides examples of my work and a description of my work experience and areas of interest.

You can see my personal bio site live using [this link](https://kaitlynvanhook.netlify.app/ "Personal Bio Site").

The homepage serves as a portfolio with cards including a screenshot of the webpage, a live link to the page, and a link to the GitHub repo.

The footer contains contact information and a brief description of the technologies I use in my projects.
